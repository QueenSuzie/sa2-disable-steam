Version=1.0.1
Description=Disables Steam Integration in game which prevents things like opening up the fake leaderboard full of hacked times, opening up the pointless achievements nonsense, checking your internet connection to interrupt your game play if you go offline despite the game not needing an internet connection really etc.\r\n\r\nNote: This mod does not disable the initial steam checks that determine whether you have the Battle DLC, nor does it prevent piracy checks.
